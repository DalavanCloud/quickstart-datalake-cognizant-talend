The Talend Data Lake Accelerator will get you launched on your journey rapdily with a simple but highly relevant workflow focused on common Data Lake use cases.

Talend allows you to ingest and process your Data Lake workloads in a variety of ways depending on your requirements.  Use lightweight JVM's for ingest of data, use pushdown ELT style processing with Hive or Redshift to visually transform your data, or use the full power of Spark for more complex processing.
